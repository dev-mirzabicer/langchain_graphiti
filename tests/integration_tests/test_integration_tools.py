    Test the AddEpisodeTool and SearchGraphTool in an integrated workflow.
    
    This test performs the following steps:
    1. Creates a GraphitiClient to connect to the database.
    2. Cleans up any old data and sets up indices.
    3. Instantiates the AddEpisodeTool and SearchGraphTool.
    4. Uses the AddEpisodeTool to add a new episode.
    5. Uses the SearchGraphTool to find the newly added episode.
    6. Asserts that the search results contain the expected information.
    7. Cleans up the test data.
